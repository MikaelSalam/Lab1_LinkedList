Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or device before giving permission or granting access to resources. Authentication is a very important process because it protects data and keeps the system secure. By requesting verification of users, it helps stop system breaches, potential hacking and the theft of important data.
Authentication falls into three main categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. The knowledge category is based on the knowledge of the user which is information that the user only knows such as a password or pin or answers to security questions. The possession category is mainly about what the user possesses which can be a physical security key, a device or a smart card. The inherence category relies on the user’s unique biological or behavioural traits, such as fingerprint scans, facial recognition, voiceprints or retinal patterns. Systems often combine the categories for stronger authentication security.
Multi-factor authentication is when a user is required to provide two or more authentication factors. Two factor authentication, a common type of MFA, uses two methods such as logging in with a password (knowledge) and then entering a pin or code from a device, mainly a phone (Possession). Three factor authentication requires one factor from each of the categories. For example, a user may log in with a password(knowledge), use a hardware token(possession), and complete a fingerprint scan(inherence). Authentication is very essential in today’s time for example in online banking, working systems, and social media. It is important in keeping data secure.
